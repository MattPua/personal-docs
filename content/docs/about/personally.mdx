- learnt how to juggle from an old coworker, who used to work in the circus; I watched him balance a chair on his chin in the office, as well as juggle flaming torches in a casino. 
  - Juggling is like riding a bike, once you learn, you never forget. 
  - I also performed in juggling shows that we performed at Christmas parties, which included juggling while standing on someones shoulders which is way easier than it looks.
- Dragonboat has a special place in my heart
  - first joined a university team in 2012, and basically have either been paddling or coaching ever since.
  - i have spent the better part of the last 9 years just in one team alone
  - paddling is in fact, not rowing despite what everyone might think
  - if you ever are looking for a sport to meet A LOT of people, this is the one to do.
