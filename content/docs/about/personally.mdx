## Fun Facts
- learnt how to juggle from an old coworker, who used to work in the circus; I watched him balance a chair on his chin in the office, as well as juggle flaming torches in a casino. 
  - Juggling is like riding a bike, once you learn, you never forget. 
  - I also performed in juggling shows that we performed at Christmas parties, which included juggling while standing on someones shoulders which is way easier than it looks.
- i once particpated in an entrepreneurship competition hosted by the US Embassy in Ottawa, Canada.
  - our idea was called `ParKING` and was meant to help people find parking spots easier. In hindsight, it wasnt actually a terrible idea. (Imagine a car, with like a crown on top of it for the logo)

### Cat
- I have a cat, her name is Lulu (named after Final Fantasy X's Lulu)
  - I grew up never having pets, not being a cat person, and now im the cat person who has tonnes of photos of their cat in their phone
  - i highly encourage people to adopt. local shelters have tonnes of cats that need homes, especially after covid.

## Dragonboat

I've been doing [Dragonboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_boat) for a long time, and it has a special place in my heart
  - first joined the University of Toronto's Engineering Iron Dragons in 2012 and spent my university years with them
  - since graduating, I joined a local Toronto club called Paddlers Anonymous
  - i've been paddling and now coaching with the club ever since
  - paddling is in fact, not rowing despite what everyone might think
  - if you ever are looking for a sport to meet A LOT of people, this is the one to do.
  - i've spent the last several years coaching, having no prior experience coaching but decided to yolo.


## Lifting

I've been lifting since university (2011), got a bit more seriously in 2015 with a go into powerlifting. 

After a number of years of: 
  - midnight sessions that were 2.5 hours long
  - more injuries than I would like to admit
  - generally losing my enjoyment of the sport

I decided to switch to a more general fitness approach, that is less injury prone, and more sustainable.

### Gym Records

<GymCards exercises={[{exercise: "Squat", weight: 400}, {exercise: "Bench Press", weight: 300}, {exercise: "Deadlift", weight: 500}]} />

### Rowing Machine

My current fascination has been with the concept 2 rowing machine. A great all around workout, that has the added benefit of also being a great cardio workout, which is something I've heavily neglected in recent years.
