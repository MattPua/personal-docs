You have reached the documentation of Matt Pua. Inspired by friends and people I've seen online posting about their life beyond what looks good on Social.

This is a dumping ground of all the little things I've learnt over time, and I wanted to start writing it all down, <ins>**because surely**</ins>, there's at least one thing in here that's useful to someone.


## Who am I?

The work-related stuff:

Developer & 2x founder in Toronto, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

Co-founder at [Cloudglue](https://cloudglue.dev) and [ArtemisCalendar](https://artemiscalendar.com).
