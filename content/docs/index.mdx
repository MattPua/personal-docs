# Welcome to my documentation!

You have reached the documentation of Matt Pua. This is a dumping ground of all the little things I've learnt over time, and I wanted to start writing it all down, before I forget it all.

Developer & second time founder in Toronto, Canada. 

Co-founder at [Cloudglue](https://cloudglue.dev) and [ArtemisCalendar](https://artemiscalendar.com). 

Previously engineering at multiple startups, including Roofr, & Pixlee, founding engineer at Bird&Be, and an early stint as a tech consultant at Slalom.
